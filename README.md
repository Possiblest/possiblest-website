# Possiblest Website - CORRECTED VERSION

## Files to Upload to GitHub:

1. **index.html** - Main website file
2. **favicon.jpg** - Browser tab icon (32x32px)
3. **logo.jpg** - Navigation logo (100x114px)

## Upload Instructions:

### Step 1: Delete Old Files from GitHub
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/possiblest-website
2. Delete the old `possiblest-premium-final.html` file

### Step 2: Upload These 3 Files
1. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop ALL 3 files:
   - index.html
   - favicon.jpg  
   - logo.jpg
3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Wait for Vercel
- Vercel will automatically detect the changes
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
- Visit your site: https://possiblest-website.vercel.app/

## What's Fixed:

✅ **Images are now external files** (not embedded) - fixes the loading errors
✅ **Favicon will appear** in browser tab
✅ **Logo will appear** in top-left navigation
✅ **All sections will display** correctly when scrolling
✅ **No more blank white space** between sections

## File Structure in GitHub Should Be:

```
your-repo/
├── index.html
├── favicon.jpg
└── logo.jpg
```

That's it! Just these 3 files.

## Still Having Issues?

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes after uploading
3. Check Vercel deployment logs

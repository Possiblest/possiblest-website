# Possiblest Website - Deployment Instructions

## IMPORTANT: You uploaded the wrong file!

The file you uploaded appears to be `possiblest-premium-final.html` but it needs to be named **`index.html`** for Vercel to work properly.

## Quick Fix:

### Option 1: Rename in GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Find the file `possiblest-premium-final.html`
3. Click on it
4. Click the pencil icon to edit
5. Change the filename at the top to just: `index.html`
6. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
7. Vercel will automatically redeploy

### Option 2: Re-upload
1. Download the file I provided called `index.html`
2. Delete `possiblest-premium-final.html` from GitHub
3. Upload `index.html` to GitHub
4. Vercel will automatically redeploy

## Files You Need:

Just ONE file: **`index.html`**

That's it! The file contains everything:
- ✅ All CSS styling
- ✅ All JavaScript
- ✅ Favicon (embedded)
- ✅ Logo (embedded)
- ✅ Fonts (from Google CDN)

## After Fixing:

Your website should display properly with:
- Company logo in navigation
- Favicon in browser tab
- All sections visible (About, Services, Vision, Mission, Contact)
- Professional styling throughout

## Still Not Working?

If the site still shows blank sections after renaming to `index.html`, try:
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel to finish deploying
3. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
